# bwd
It was made for running under Ubuntu OS but may work in others Linux distros.  
Creates a basic web site structure. So basic it hurts.  
Helpful for beginners or to create quick prototypes.

## Install
```shell
git clone https://github.com/rdlagemann/bwd.git  
cd bwd  
source spell.sh
```
## Use
Just:
```shell
bwd <project-name>
```

## Note
`bwd` is an **alias** to *basic_web_dir.sh*. You can rename it if you want.  
Just change it in *spell.sh*.
